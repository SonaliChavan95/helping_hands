              As a donor, we empower you to make sure that the things you don't need anymore reach someone that
              needs it, and doesn't end up as waste in a landfill.
              <br>
              When you join us as a recipient, you can look for things you need using our advanced search feature.
              We also offer you a convenient way to save your requested items: in the cart; come back to it
              anytime -- as long as it hasn't been snapped up by anyone else.
              <br>
              Rest assured, our Administrator(s) are always alert to vet donations and enforce all guidelines;
              Any user(donor or recipient) that violates our <a href='/terms&conditions'>terms and conditions</a> WILL
              be reported to the authorities.

              as a felony by law,
              will warrant a suspension or a permanent ban from our platform.

              We are here to help communities not spread spam or enable scamsters. As such, we take out responsibilities
